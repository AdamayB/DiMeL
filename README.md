# DiMeL = Distance Measuring LEDs
Glow a particular LED if an object is in a specific distance range.

Using an Arduino Uno R3 board I made a project in which a different LED is powered on depending on the distance of obstacle.

Due to unavailabilty of an Ultrasonic Sensor, this project has been made only on TinkerCAD.

I am a beginner and have been learning auduino for a month, so this basic project is here to track my progress. 
It will be improved further and maybe used in combination with future projects.
